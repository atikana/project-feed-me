### Description of the web application
On the FEED ME website, if you are debating on what you want for dinner, then use the dinner randomization to select a random dinner recipe. There is also with an option to search for a recipe given the ingredients, and an option to filter out any recipes containing your allergies. You can also create an account to save favourite recipes or dinner dishes. 

### Key features that will be completed by the Beta version
1. Dinner Wheel randomization: Users can add dinner dishes to the wheel or select from the website's recipe lists and let the wheel design what to eat for you.
2. Recipe search engine: Search for recipes returned based on ingredients or similar dish names. Users can also have the option to filter search results
3. Recipe Page and Navigation: Build upon the web gallery assignment, we will be using a grid navigation to display a list of recipes. Users can click each grid to go to the recipe page where a recipe will be given with a YouTube video embedded. Users can also navigate directly from the recipe page to move between recipes. Nearest restaurants that sell the recipe will also be displayed on google map

### Additional features that will be complete by the Final version
1. User profile and Customization: Users can signup & login to their account. After logging in, users will have the option to save the search history which will be taken into account when displaying dinner search results. Users will also be able to save their favourite recipes. The website will do a recommendation dinner list using user search history.
2. Improved recipe page and navigation, we will be adding categories and top recipe for each as voted by the users. Most searched etc.
